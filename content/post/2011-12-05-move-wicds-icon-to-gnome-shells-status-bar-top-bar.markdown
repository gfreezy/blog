After I saw a extension of gnome-shell to move pidgin's icon to the
status bar, I tried to roll my own extension following the
extension's source to move the wicd's icon to the status bar too.
I followed the post [Adding pidgin icon to gnome-shell status tray](http://mo.morsi.org/blog/node/337).

All I did is just to change the name of pidgin to wicd. After reboot
my gnome-shell, it worked. Wicd's icon appeared in status bar(top bar).
